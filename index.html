  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>It is the prototype of a game based on gravitation.</p>
  <p>You are the orange thing, imagine that it is a space ship and that you are the commander.</p>
  <p>The black thing in the center is a Black Hole. Currently, it does not matter if you fall into it, but actually if you 'touch' the Black Hole then you are dead.</p>

  <h2>It does not work, what the heck?!</h2>
  <p>Well, it is just a prototype, so this is not optimized for all web browsers! I developped and tested it on Firefox 35.0.1 and it works pretty well.</p>
  <p>Also it used Javascript, therefore try to not disable it in your browser.</p>

  <h2>I found a bug and I want to tell you...</h2>
  <p>I guess you can go <a href="https://github.com/Noyau/GravitationPrototype">here</a>.</p>
